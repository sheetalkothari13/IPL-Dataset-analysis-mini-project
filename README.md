# 🏏 IPL Dataset Analysis – Mini Project

## 📌 Overview
This mini-project analyzes **IPL player performance and salaries** across multiple seasons (2015–2024) using **Python (NumPy & Matplotlib)**.  
The goal is to identify **trends, patterns, and insights** in terms of:
- Players’ salaries over the years
- Games played per season
- Points scored per season
- Salary-to-performance relationships

The analysis is done in a **Jupyter Notebook** style and includes visualizations for better understanding.
