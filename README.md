🏏 IPL Dataset Analysis – Mini Project
📌 Overview

This mini-project focuses on analyzing IPL player performance and salaries across multiple seasons using Python (NumPy & Matplotlib). The project highlights trends, patterns, and insights in terms of:

Players’ salaries over the years

Games played per season

Points scored per season

Salary-to-performance relationships

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook style, demonstrating step-by-step exploratory data analysis with visualizations.

🔧 Tech Stack

Python 🐍

NumPy – data handling & computations

Matplotlib – data visualizations
